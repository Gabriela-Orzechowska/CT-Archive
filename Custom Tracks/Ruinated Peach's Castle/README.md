# Ruinated Peach's Castle
## Overview 
**Ruinated Peach's Castle** is a custom track created by Gabriela_. It takes place around the now-destroyed Peach's Castle, that was taken over by Black Mist and Ruination.

## Notes
The theme behind this track might be not that understandable for most players, especially for the first time, the greenish tint everywhere is something that might not fit in this type of a track not knowing the lore.

The idea of merging 2 worlds, being Mario Universe as well as LoL's Runeterra, comes from the in-game visual novel event called "Rise of the Sentinels" which gave the players one of the more interesting part of LoL's lore.
"Ruination" refers to it, not as in context of what normally "ruined" means. 

The lore of Ruination is way longer than that as it originally started 1000 years before the events visible in the cinematics below, which's story is told in a novel called "Ruination", as well as few years before cinematic in game "Ruined King". 
Generally, Viego was once a ruler of long-lost kingdom called Camavor, he had a wife named Isolde, which one day was poisoned and she unfortunately died. Viego tried to revive her using water from Blessed Isles, as it was believed it had magical properties, unfortunately instead of that Isolde's shadow attacked him with his own sword and the mix of it and blessed water started the Ruination and released the Black Mist. One of the results was changing Blessed Isles into Shadow Isles.

These cinematics can be a good introduction of what the Ruination and Black Mist is, and they were the main inspiration behind the track. They dont tell the full story as big part of it was in the visual novel in the client, which is no longer available:

Originally this track wasn't supposed to even have a destroyed castle, more close a normal looking one that was attacked by the blast mist. Although I decided to add an actual destruction of the castle because for people not knowing anything from Runeterra it would be really confusion where that "ruined" part is.

The designs of characters inside the cells were inspired by Ruined skin line, and the idea behind them looking at the player come from finishers in Valorant, where there were some Ruination themed weapons.
Also no, the fog appearing when sitting in one place of the track is not a bug. Its supposed to represent the effect of human being affected by Black Mist for too long.

This track could be a lot better, but after the amount of drama there was inside the CTGP Thread I wasn't even sure if I want to finish it. I was also expecting getting some hate because the track is themed after "League of Legends" and yeah, that also happened plenty of times.

### Removed stuff
Yeah, sadly the track had to get some of the cool stuff planned removed from final release, due to issues with some people or generally lack of the skill required.

Firstly, I wanted the end of the track to look different. During development there was a cut available that would cut quite a big chunk of time, performed similarly to last ramp shroomless, but on the second side (The fences allowed for that). I had an idea to make some kind of tower, that over time would fall, preferable near the end of lap 3 which would block the cut, but would be replaced by shroomless ending strat. It would give the track way better feeling as a "ruined" theme. But unfortunately people really hated the idea and I had to change it after some not kind comments.
I wanted to add some more subtle overtime destruction elements, like falling bricks, some dust or gravel falling etc. It would be awesome, but I wasn't sure how to achieve it without looking all the sanity, the track would need to be more detailed, which we know its not.

Another cool thing I wanted to add was a short cutscene at the beginning of the race which would show a dragon flying by, rawring, destroying something and just flying away. I wasnt sure how to properly implement that as I am a horrible animator.
Later she would vibe somewhere in her human form. Instead I decided to just hide her as a easter egg somewhere sleeping in her dragon form :) (Which isn't lore accurate but whatever)
